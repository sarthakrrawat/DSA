LeetCode Solutions Repository
Welcome to my LeetCode Solutions repository! This is a personal project where I solve LeetCode problems to strengthen my understanding of data structures and algorithms (DSA), prepare for technical interviews, and improve problem-solving skills.

Repository Structure
/python/: Solutions currently written in Python.

/cpp/ (upcoming): Solutions in C++ as I transition to practicing DSA with C++.

/notes/: Strategy notes, concepts, and patterns learned from problems.

README.md: Project overview, improvement plans, and roadmap.

How to Use
Browse the folders to find problem solutions organized by language.

Use the notes to review common problem-solving patterns and strategies.

Feel free to open issues for discussion or suggest improvements.

Plans for Improvement
As I continue refining this repository, here are ways I aim to improve:

Add tags or labels for problem difficulty and topics to enhance navigation.

Include explanations or summaries alongside solutions for difficult problems.

Automate syncing new LeetCode submissions using tools like LeetHub or GitHub Actions.

Add unit tests where applicable for verifying solution correctness and edge cases.

Transition from Python to C++ for DSA
To deepen my understanding and improve efficiency, I plan to shift from Python to C++ by:

Continuously solving problems in Python to solidify concepts.

Setting up a C++ environment and beginning to translate existing solutions.

Learning and applying the STL (Standard Template Library) for more effective coding.

Eventually solving new problems primarily in C++ to prepare for competitive programming and low-level understanding.

Documenting differences, performance, and language features I encounter during the transition.
